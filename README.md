# OOP ZOO Homework

### Description
This application is used to see how inheritence works in OOP (Object-Oriented Programing). The application is based around a zoo where animals can inherit from their species, for example gorilla is a mammal which will inherit everything a mammal has. 

### Languages used
* Ruby

### Challenges 
1. Inheritance - this was a struggle for me as I wasn't sure as to how to write up the inheritence from Animal to Mammal class. After researching online and trial & error I got it to work.

### Learning points

1. There are 4 pillars in OOP:
    * Abstraction
    * Encapsulation
    * Inheritance
    * Polymorphism
2. `include` is used for loading a method and `require` is used to run another file.
